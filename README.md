# Text Input with PHP/AJAX

Create a form using HTML that will render a text input field and submit button.

The text input should not allow any non-alphanumeric characters. Upon entering data and selecting the submit button, the data should be sent to a back end endpoint (developed using PHP) using AJAX.

The back end will need to check if the string entered is a palindrome, and return a success or error message to the user on the front end.

_You are welcome to use Laravel, Drupal, Magento or WordPress. However, no other frameworks or content management systems may be used._

## Evaluation
Feel free to ask your tester all the questions you need to ask if need be, or if you need any clarification on the requirements.

When complete, create a private repository in Bitbucket and invite these users to access your repo `lambrosphotios` `stn5-shass` `rpangilinan-s5` `alexkreuz`.

We will evaluate your response based on the following criteria:

* Code should be easy to read and understand, with little to no comments required.
* Reduce code duplication; prefer use of abstracting functionality.
* Problem solving and design approach.
* Extra credit is provided to those who solve this problem using Drupal or Magento, despite these frameworks offering far more functionality than is required of this test.
